# Python I at NICAR 17
### The first hour of a three-hour series on learning Python

Here's a pretty basic introduction to Python that I'll try to cover in 60 minutes. That is _not_ enough time to learn much Python, so we'll be touching on a some big concepts in brief periods and you will definitely have to go back and review this material, and practice. Learning Python is an investment, a good one. But you won't walk out of here feeling like a guru. Hopefully you'll walk out of here recognizing the potential power of learning a language such as this. 

###Here are the basic topics we're going to cover: 
- What's the point? 
- What does a script look like? 
- What are the building blocks of a script? 
- How important is white space? 
- What is a library? 
- What are loops?
